## Description

### Purpose

The purpose of this portfolio is to represent myself as a aspiring software developer in a professional manner. The layout has been designed with simplicity and professionalism in mind. The colour palette was also chosen for this reason. Black, dark blue, white and grey to demonstate simplicity and professionalism with orange sprinkled in as it is my favourite colour.

### Functionality / Features

The portfolio has four main pages. The home page is used as an overview displaying an about me section that serves as an introduction to myself and what drives me. This is followed by a skills section that shows the coding languages I am knowledgable in and brief paragraphs on my hard and soft skills. An API to my github graph is used to interest viewers and also give attention to the document. I also added in my linkedin banner for further representation of myself.
